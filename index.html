    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Roselyne Kheri, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I thrive on turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites. My journey in web development began with a curiosity for creating digital experiences, and it has evolved into a commitment to staying updated with the latest technologies.

    I enjoy the process of problem-solving and find satisfaction in crafting elegant solutions. Whether it's designing responsive layouts, implementing dynamic features, or optimizing for performance, I approach each project with enthusiasm and dedication. My goal is not just to write code but to create seamless and enjoyable online experiences.

    Beyond coding, I'm a certified psychologist and an avid learner, always exploring new frameworks and tools to enhance my skill set. I believe in the power of collaboration and am eager to contribute my expertise to innovative projects. Let's build something incredible together!
